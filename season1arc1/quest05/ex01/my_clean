In a file called my_clean place the command line that will search for all files - in the current directory as well as in its sub-directories - with a name ending by ~, or a name that start and end by #

The command line will print and delete all files found.
Only one command is allowed: no ; or && or other gitaneries.

Example 00

$>my_clean
./.zshrc~
...
./blah/#tat#
$>
Tip
You should dig into the command find (man find)



find . \( -name "*~" -o -name "#*#" \)


Explanation:

find is the command used to search for files in the file system.
. specifies the current directory as the starting point for the search.
-name is used to search for files with a specific name pattern.
"*~" matches files with a name ending with "~".
"#*#" matches files with a name that starts and ends with "#".
-o (or) is used to combine the two search conditions.
The parentheses ( and ) are used to group the search conditions together.
